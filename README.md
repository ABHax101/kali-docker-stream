To start container, cd to project directory and run: `docker build -t ubuntu-novnc-ratpoison . && docker run --name ubuntu-novnc-ratpoison -p 80:80 -d ubuntu-novnc-ratpoison`, NOTE: SSL NOT SUPPORTED. You can use cloudflare's ssl in flexible mode and create a DNS record pointing to your host machine, it'll work as long as the DNS record's traffic is proxied by cloudflare.
